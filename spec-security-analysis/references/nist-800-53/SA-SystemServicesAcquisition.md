# SA - System and Services Acquisition

**Family**: System and Services Acquisition  
**Controls**: 22  
**Focus**: SDLC, supply chain, development security

## When to Apply

**SA is PRIMARY for development practices.** Apply when your component:
- Is under active development
- Uses third-party dependencies
- Requires security in SDLC
- Has supply chain concerns

## Mapping Guidance

### Development (SA-3, SA-8, SA-11, SA-15)
```
NFR-XXX (SDLC) → SA-3
NFR-XXX (Secure Design) → SA-8
NFR-XXX (Testing) → SA-11
NFR-XXX (Standards) → SA-15
```

### Supply Chain (SA-9, SA-22, SA-24)
```
NFR-XXX (Dependencies) → SA-9, SA-24
NFR-XXX (EOL Tracking) → SA-22
```
