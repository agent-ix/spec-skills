# Master Requirements Specification  
## <Project Name>

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **scope, intent, and governing requirements framework** for the <Project Name> Python state machine library.

It establishes:
- The problem space addressed by the library
- The boundaries of responsibility
- The authoritative structure for requirements, verification, and change control
- The relationship between user intent, system behavior, and test evidence

This document is the **top-level requirements artifact** for the repository.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope

This specification governs:
- Core state machine behavior
- State lifecycle management
- Transition rules and validation
- Event handling semantics
- Error and failure handling behavior
- Public APIs that affect observable behavior
- Deterministic execution guarantees

### 2.2 Out of Scope

This specification does not govern:
- Application-specific business logic
- UI or visualization layers
- Deployment concerns
- Integrations beyond defined interfaces
- Experimental or prototype features not promoted to requirements

---

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 System Description

<High-level description of the Python state machine library, its purpose, and the problems it solves.>

### 3.2 Intended Users

- <Library consumers>
- <Framework integrators>
- <Tooling or platform developers>

---

## 4. Requirements Architecture

Requirements are decomposed and managed using a **hierarchical structure** consistent with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148.

## 5. Requirement Classes

### 5.1 Stakeholder Requirements

Stakeholder Requirements capture **authoritative needs and expectations**.

- Format: `StR-XXX`
- Location: `stakeholder/`
- Nature: Normative for intent
- Purpose: Drive system requirements

---

### 5.2 User Requirements

User Stories describe **intent, expectations, and usage outcomes**.

- Format: `US-XXX`
- Location: `usecase/`
- Nature: Informational, non-binding
- Purpose: Drive functional requirements

---

### 5.3 Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements define **authoritative, testable system behavior**.

- Format: `FR-XXX`
- Location: `functional/`
- Nature: Normative and binding
- Purpose: Define observable behavior

All functional requirements:
- Use deterministic language
- Are independently testable
- Trace back to one or more user requirements

---

### 5.4 Non-Functional Requirements

Non-Functional Requirements define **quality constraints** (performance, security, etc.).

- Format: `NFR-XXX`
- Location: `non-functional/`
- Nature: Normative and binding
- Purpose: Constrain system qualities

---

### 5.5 Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria define **verifiable outcomes** for functional requirements.

- Format: `{FR-XXX}-AC-N`
- Location: Within each functional requirement file
- Purpose: Verification anchor

---

## 6. Requirement Identification

### 6.1 Identifier Schema

| Artifact | Format | Example |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Stakeholder Requirement | `StR-XXX` | `StR-001` |
| User Story | `US-XXX` | `US-002` |
| Functional Requirement | `FR-XXX` | `FR-014` |
| Non-Functional Requirement | `NFR-XXX` | `NFR-003` |
| Acceptance Criteria | `{FR}-AC-N` | `FR-014-AC-1` |
| Test Case | `TC-XXX` | `TC-021` |
| Change Request | `CR-XXX` | `CR-009` |

Identifiers are immutable once assigned.

---

## 7. Requirement Quality Policy

All **functional requirements** SHALL:
- Define observable behavior
- Be unambiguous and atomic
- Avoid implementation details unless required
- Be testable through explicit criteria

Functional requirements SHALL NOT:
- Encode application-specific policy
- Contain compound behaviors
- Use subjective language

---

## 8. State and Execution Model

### 8.1 State Semantics

<System-wide definition of what constitutes a state, terminal state, and transitional state.
Each managed lifecycle SHALL have a corresponding FR with `domain: state_machine`
in `spec/functional/` providing the canonical parseable definition.>

### 8.2 Transition Semantics

<System-wide rules for valid transitions, guards, and invalid transitions.>

### 8.3 Determinism Guarantees

<Statements about execution order, determinism, and concurrency assumptions.>

---

## 9. Events and Signals

### 9.1 Event Model

<Overview of domain events. Each service SHALL have at least one event catalog FR
with `domain: event` in `spec/functional/` defining canonical event types and schemas.>

### 9.2 Event Guarantees

- Ordering guarantees
- Delivery guarantees
- Failure semantics

---

## 10. Error and Failure Model

### 10.1 Error Classification

- Configuration errors
- Runtime execution errors
- Invalid transition attempts

### 10.2 Failure Handling Guarantees

<System-wide expectations for error propagation, recovery, and reporting.>

---

## 11. Traceability

Bidirectional traceability SHALL be maintained between:
- Stakeholder Requirements → User Stories / Functional Requirements
- User Requirements → Functional Requirements
- Functional Requirements → Acceptance Criteria
- Acceptance Criteria → Test Cases

Traceability is recorded in `traceability_matrix.md`.

---

## 12. Verification Strategy

Functional requirements SHALL be verified using one or more of:
- Automated tests
- Manual tests
- Analysis
- Inspection

Verification evidence SHALL reference test cases in `test_cases/`.

---

## 13. Change Management

All requirements artifacts are **configuration-controlled items**.

- Changes are proposed via change requests (`CR-XXX`)
- Changes require impact analysis
- Approved changes update affected requirements, tests, and traceability
- Historical versions are preserved

---

## 14. Lifecycle Status

Functional requirements MAY declare a lifecycle status:
- DRAFT
- APPROVED
- IMPLEMENTED
- VERIFIED
- DEPRECATED

---

## 15. Governance Notes

- This document defines **system intent**, not implementation
- Functional requirements SHALL precede code changes
- Proof-of-concept code SHALL only exist when explicitly requested
- Deprecated requirements SHALL be archived, not removed
